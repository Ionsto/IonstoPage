Or if this tank had bigger guns? I decided that i would try and understand what happened "under the hood".</p><p>Finally I also had a love of simulations - games where I could sit back and watch it <i>go</i>!</p><ul></ul><h1>Projects</h1><h3>Raytracing - 2020</h3><p>I wanted to write a GPGPU raytracer, this was the other half of my lofty goal of rewriting waterflow in 3d
I played around with 3d fluid and sand simulations, but also worked on a 3d visulisation that would allow the water to be at the forefront.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJOTpEgKsbY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><a href="https://github.com/Ionsto/WaterFlowRT">Waterflow Raytraced</a><h3>Waterflow3D - 2019 onwards</h3><p>I wanted to revisit the original waterflow idea and move it into 3d.
The original plan was to create an eulerian fluid simulation and slap that into a voxel world.
I ended up writing a simple fluid sim, and smoothed partical hydrodynamics system (SPH) and a material point method (MPM) simluation.
None of these ran at a frame budget and accuracy required and this will be revisited.</p><p>The material point method could feasibly handle the 3d sand and water multiphase sim - but currently runs too slow.
