        <h1>Hunt</h1>
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        This is an prototype project for a game
        <br />
        The concept of the game is that the player and the AI are in exactly the same situation. 
        The player and the AI are both using exactly the same inputs and outputs to interact with the game.
        Bolt on a fast paced nerual network and you have a <i>Hunting</i> game.
        <br><br>
        The world is 2d - but the users can see a psedo 3d representation of it.

        The only way they can see the world is the colour of a ray, it's angle and it's depth.
        <br>
        From a top down perspective you can imagine every camera like this.
        <br>
        <image src="Top Down.png"></image>
        <br>
        But it get's interesting if you consider the actor's point of view. [Different scene]
        <br>
        <image src="World_Render.png" style="border-style: solid"></image>
        <br>
        <h2>Rendering</h2>
        Doing full scale raytracing is very hard and very slow. If every actor in a game had to render out an image the player would also enjoy you would have to run at 0.001FPS.
        <br>
        The solution was to stylise the game such that it could be easy to render. Every actor is a circle - or a combination of circles.
        <br>
        There is only a 2d plane of rays to worry about - the final 3d image is a trick.
        Each ray only has 1 bounce.
        <br>
        Finally you have a mist factor - that tends all colours to white as the tend towards a "max ray distance".
        <br>
        <br>
        The resulting data is not useful or interesting to look at - so a postprocessor (the real rendering engine) draws a rectangle for each ray.
        <br>
        The height is inversly proportional to the distance: height = screenheight * (ray_distance-maxdistance)/maxdistance
        <br>
        The colour is a linear blend between the sample colour and 255,255,255
        <br>

        <h2>AI</h2>
        The most interesting part of the project was making actors that could work within the system.
        The rendering engine created data that could almost exactly be fed into feed forward neural networks.
        <br>
        Auxillary data was fed in about current velocities (linear and angular) this allowed actors to stop themeselves spinning out of control.
        <br>
        Most input values are remapped to 0:1 or -1:1.
        <br>
        The output controls were delta angular rotation, move forwards (along look angle), strafe (perpedicular to look angle).
        <h2>Training</h2>
        Since the player is hunting - they need somthing to hunt. The AI's job is to realisticly react to hunting behevier - like cover or flanking manuvures.
        Training neural networks takes lots of data - which I don't have. The second best way of training neural networks is to create data for them.
        <br>
        I realised I could use genetic algorithms to generate my network weights.
        The training scenerao is two predetators attempting to catch a single prey in a small box.
        The predetors win if they are close enough to the prey. The prey wins after a time limit is reached.
        <br>
        <br>
        Two pools of random networks are created - one prey one predator.
        <br>
        All predetor networks and prey networks play eachother.
        <br>
        The scenario has positions randomised to remove overfitting.
        <br>
        Multiple scenarios are run per matchup.
        <br><br>
        The only metric gathered is Wins and Games played. Both populations are sorted by win rate.
        <br>
        The bottom half of the population is replaced with randomised versions of the top half.
        The cycle starts again.
