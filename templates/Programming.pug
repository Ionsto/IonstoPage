            p I became interested in programming from a really young age.<br>
            p Growing up playing games like Red Alert - and wondered how cool it would be if X did Y? Or if this tank had bigger guns? I decided that i would try and understand what happened "under the hood".
            p Finally I also had a love of simulations - games where I could sit back and watch it <i>go</i>!

                I wanted to write a GPGPU raytracer, this was the other half of my lofty goal of rewriting waterflow in 3d
                I played around with 3d fluid and sand simulations, but also worked on a 3d visulisation that would allow the water to be at the forefront.

                Have you ever played on a beach - and made dams to hold the water flowing out with the tide?
                Now you can do it in the browser (WebGL powered)
