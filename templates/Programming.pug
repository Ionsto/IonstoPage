            p I became interested in programming from a really young age.<br>
            p Growing up playing games like Red Alert - and wondered how cool it would be if X did Y? Or if this tank had bigger guns? I decided that i would try and understand what happened "under the hood".
            p Finally I also had a love of simulations - games where I could sit back and watch it <i>go</i>!
