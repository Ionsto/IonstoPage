            text. 
                I became interested in programming from a really young age.<br>
                I used to play games like Red Alert - and wonder how cool it would be if X did Y? Or if this tank had bigger guns? I decided that i would try and understand what happened "under the hood".

            p I also had a love of simulations - games where i could sit back and watch it <i>go</i>!

            p My first language was C,
            p C was a mistake
            p My second language was BASIC...
            p I now love C++ - and begrudgingly use python
